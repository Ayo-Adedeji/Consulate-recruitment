## 🚨 CRITICAL: What YOU Need to Do

### Priority 1: Deal with Old WordPress Site (URGENT!)

The old WordPress site is competing with your new site. You MUST:

**Option A: Delete it completely**
- Contact your WordPress hosting provider
- Delete the old site
- This removes the competition

**Option B: Redirect it (RECOMMENDED)**
- Set up 301 redirects from old site to new site
- This transfers the SEO value to your new site
- Tells Google the new site is the official one

**Why this matters**: Google sees two sites and doesn't know which is the "real" Consulate Recruitment. Until you fix this, the old site will keep ranking higher.

### Priority 2: Submit to Google Search Console (Required!)

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Add your site: `https://consulaterecruitment.co.uk`
3. Verify ownership
4. Submit sitemap: `https://consulaterecruitment.co.uk/sitemap.xml`
5. Request indexing

**Why this matters**: Without this, Google won't know your new site exists!

### Priority 3: Create Google Business Profile

1. Go to: https://www.google.com/business
2. Create profile for "Consulate Recruitment"
3. Add all business details
4. Verify your business

**Why this matters**: Shows up in Google Maps and local searches. Essential for local SEO.

### Priority 4: Install Google Analytics

Follow the guide in `GOOGLE-ANALYTICS-SETUP.md`

**Why this matters**: You need to track if your SEO efforts are working!
